Learning comes in countless forms. Doing, reading, watching, listening, writing, exploring, tinkering, hacking, tasting, touching, smelling, ... There is no one best way to learn. There is only the best way to learn that works for YOU and what you want to learn.

Let's play with some examples. 

You don't read 5 cooking books and wake up tomorrow with a perfect dish. You can only learn cooking by tasting and actually doing it.

But you can learn history just by sitting and reading books or watching videos.

You don't learn coding by reading all the rules and all the best practices that ever existed. You can only learn it by writing programs, tinkering existing codes, and hacking new creative use.

So the sooner you figure out the best way to learn a certain thing, the faster you can learn. And the faster you can learn, the more valuable you can be.

## Helpful Tips
- It is more important on what you learn than how you learn it. So pick the right stuff to learn.
- Explore various methods of learning. Try out new way. Pick the one that works for you and stop the one that doesn't.
- Always retrospect how efficient you learn. Reflect and measure. Ask, "Will it stick with me until next week?" If you eventually forget, change strategy. If you spend 3 days learning it, and you completely forget it after a week, you might just waste 72 hours. So make sure it worths something, even a bit.
- Observe what distract you from achieving optimal outcome.
- As quickly as you can, create a very very small achievable goals. It can just be 1-2 hours work. Commit. If you get through that, it will get easier to work on the next tiny goals. Tiny goals are so underrated.
- Make your learning fun! Break the rules! Do stupid stuff! It makes learning a lot less boring.
